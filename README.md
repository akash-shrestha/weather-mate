# Weather Mate app

## About

App where user can enter a location and find the weather information about the valid location

## Getting started

(General steps)

- Clone the repo
- Navigate to root dir
- Create .env from .env.example (The api key included is probably valid)
- Run 'npm install'
- Run 'npm start'
- Visit 'http://localhost:3000/'

_Note: Use the correct node version_

#### Improvements

_The app was developed quickly ignoring some useful features. To make the Weather Mate app better, here are some suggestions_

_Code Organization and Modularity:_

- Split the code into modular components for better maintainability and reusability.
- Use a consistent coding style and follow best practices (such as proper indentation, naming conventions, etc.).
- Add comments to explain the functionality of complex code blocks or logic.

_Error Handling and Validation:_

- Implement proper error handling mechanisms throughout the application to provide meaningful error messages to the user.
- Validate user input to ensure that only valid locations are accepted for weather information retrieval.
- Handle network errors, timeouts, and API failures gracefully to provide a better user experience.

_User Interface and Design:_

- Improve the overall user interface design to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly.
- Enhance the responsiveness of the application to support different screen sizes and devices.
- Incorporate intuitive UI/UX elements such as loading spinners, error notifications, and progress indicators to provide feedback to the user.

_API Key Security:_

- Hide API keys and sensitive information by using environment variables or a configuration file. Avoid hardcoding them in the codebase.
- Store sensitive information securely and avoid exposing it in the client-side code.

_Testing:_

- Implement unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application.
- Use testing frameworks such as Jest or React Testing Library to write and run tests.

_Performance Optimization:_

- Optimize API calls by implementing caching mechanisms to reduce redundant requests and improve performance.
- Minify and bundle the application's assets to reduce the file size and improve loading times.
- Implement lazy loading or code splitting techniques to load components on-demand, improving initial load times.

_Accessibility:_

- Ensure the application adheres to accessibility guidelines and standards, making it accessible to users with disabilities.
- Use semantic HTML tags and provide alternative text for images.
- Include proper focus management and keyboard navigation support.

_Documentation and Version Control:_

- Provide detailed documentation on how to use the application, including setup instructions, usage guidelines, and any external dependencies.
- Use version control (such as Git) to track changes, make meaningful commits, and maintain a clean commit history.

_NPM Package:_

- Audit the npm package to ensure its security and check for any vulnerabilities or outdated dependencies.
- Regularly update the npm packages used in the application to benefit from bug fixes, performance improvements, and security patches.
